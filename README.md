## Summary
Whenever a webpage is designed, there are always flaws or recommendations in which you believe that prevent potential. Whether it is the appearance or the functionality, a webpage always can use some enhancements.

- Drawback
	- The only drawback I see is that a random user that visited this site would not know all the specifications of the data (e.g. Included States, Cities, Shapes, etc. when filtering). So it could benefit a user to have a dropbox function.
- Recommendations
	- Add an additional filter for the "Duration" column that inlcudes a dropbox for pre-selected time frames. 
	- Without out this dropbox function stated above in the drawback, another recommendation could be to have automatic filtering. Instead of having to click enter, the data automatic starts filter as you time and get more specific.
